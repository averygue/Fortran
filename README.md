# Fortran
Creates a 20x20 array and places 100 molecules in random spots.
Then reports how many molecules in the final arrangement have no neighbors. (not diagnonal cases)

Example:

Isolated Molecules: 3 
       * * * * M \n
       M * M M * \n
       * * * * * \n
       * M * * M \n
       * * * * M \n

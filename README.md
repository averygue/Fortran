# Fortran
Creates a 20x20 array and places 100 molecules in random spots.
Then reports how many molecules in the final arrangement have no neighbors. (not diagnonal cases)

Example:

Trial:            1
 Size of Array = 20 x 20
 Isolated Molecules Total:          29 
 <br>
 Trial:            2
 Size of Array = 20 x 20
 Isolated Molecules Total:          34
 <br>
 Trial:            3
 Size of Array = 20 x 20
 Isolated Molecules Total:          37
  <br>
 Trial:            4
 Size of Array = 20 x 20
 Isolated Molecules Total:          40
  <br>
 Trial:            5
 Size of Array = 20 x 20
 Isolated Molecules Total:          31
